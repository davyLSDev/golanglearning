# golanglearning
This repo is where I begin to learn about golang

## Reference for this software

[cli for go](https://thenewstack.io/cli-command-line-programming-with-go/)

## Fairly rich set of packages

[golang pkgs](https://golang.org/pkg/)

This makes me wonder why I would need to be able to write such things as these.
They are probably better written that I could do. However I suppose one reason is
for understanding of algorythms, another might be that there could be a specialized
application which requires more speed. It appears to me that the data drives which
sort method requires less of the Big O, or less operations or memory used.
