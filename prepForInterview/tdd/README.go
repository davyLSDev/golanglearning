## Another tutorial on TDD in golang

* this one might be better than the previous one I went through: [intro to TDD](https://tutorialedge.net/golang/intro-testing-in-go/)

## On using "testify"

* Testify helps you to simplify the way you write assertions within your test cases.
* Testify can also be used to mock objects within your testing framework to ensure you arenâ€™t calling production endpoints whenever you test.

## Notes

### godoc

Very useful utility which serves up go documentation for my system

godoc -http :8000
then navigate to http://localhost:8000/pkg/testing ... or wherever

### commit whenever you can get tests to pass

In case you mess something up, but maybe do not push to master right away.
